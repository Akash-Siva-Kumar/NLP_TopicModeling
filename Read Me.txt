To make code compact LDA model usage and BERTopic model usage- code is made into two separate ipynb files
'NLP_Topic_Modeling_LDA_Akash.ipynb'and 'NLP_Topic_Modeling_BERTopic_Akash.ipynb'

To run code.

1. Upload the data file 'newyorktimes_articles_2020_April.json' to Google Drive.

2. Open the 'NLP_Topic_Modeling_LDA_Akash.ipynb' on Google Colab.

3. Give Run all

ALL DETAILS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CODE BLOCK AND ITS WORKING IS WELL COMMENTED IN CODE AND MADE SELF EXPLANATORY ~Akash

Same steps are to be followed for 'NLP_Topic_Modeling_BERTopic_Akash.ipynb'
